# RefactoriOSWeatherAppFromMVCToMVVM

- The application allows users to search any location and presents current weather summary.
- The app uses iOS networking and threading frameworks to fetch weather information from weatherbit.io API.
- Effective use of weak and unknown references within closures to avoid memory leaks.
- The app has a custom boxing implementation with property observers for data binding between view and view-model.
- Also implemented unit testing to test view-model business logic.
